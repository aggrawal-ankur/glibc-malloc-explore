# Introduction To Userspace Memory Allocators

***A dynamic memory allocator is a userspace program that requests virtual memory from the kernel and allocates it to a running process.***

Each process gets its own instance of the allocator. When the process actually uses that piece of dynamic memory, the kernel backs it with physical memory (paging).

There are multiple "allocation strategies", each with specific advantages and tradeoffs. This gives rise to multiple allocators. For example:
  - **dlmalloc**, written by Professor Doug Lea is one of the earliest dynamic memory allocators. It's first version was released in 1987 and the last version in 2012.
  - **ptmalloc**, or pthreads malloc, was written by Wolfram Gloger in 1996 as an extension of dlmalloc to provide multithreading support. Improved versions were released around 2001 (ptmalloc2) and 2006 (ptmalloc3).
  - **glibc-malloc** integrated ptmalloc2 in v2.3 and a substantial amount of changes have been made since then. It is the default dynamic memory allocator on GNU Linux.
  - **jemalloc**, written by Jason Evans, was first used in FreeBSD. Later on, Firefox and Facebook adopted it.
  - **tcmalloc**, or thread-caching malloc, was written in Google and later open-sourced in 2005 as part of the "Google Performance Tools" (later changed to gperftools).

---

As it is a userspace program, a process can swap the default allocator provided by the OS. For example: FireFox uses jemalloc.

Therefore, an operating system can have multiple allocators installed in it. I use `Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)`. I can check the presence of some popular userspace allocators:
```bash
$ dpkg -l | grep -E "libjemalloc|libtcmalloc|libmimalloc|libdlmalloc"

ii  libjemalloc2:amd64                      5.3.0-3                              amd64        general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation
```

This proves that I have jemalloc installed on my system and a pkg depends on it. To find that pkg, we can use this command:
```bash
$ apt-cache rdepends libjemalloc2 | grep -E "^\s" | xargs dpkg -l 2>/dev/null | grep "^ii"

ii  bind9-dnsutils   1:9.20.15-1~deb13u1 amd64        Clients provided with BIND 9
ii  bind9-libs:amd64 1:9.20.15-1~deb13u1 amd64        Shared Libraries used by BIND 9
```

Firefox is not in this list because it comes with jemalloc built right in the code. We can confirm the presence of jemalloc related symbols to prove our point.
```bash
strings /proc/1699/exe | grep -i jemalloc | head -20

jemalloc_stats_internal
jemalloc_stats_num_bins
jemalloc_stats_lite
jemalloc_set_main_thread
..
```
There it is.

There is no occurrence of "glibc-malloc" because, it is shipped with `libc.so.6`. We can prove this by writing a simple C program that calls malloc and check the presence of malloc related symbols.
```bash
$ ldd main
      linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fc2a467e000)
      libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fc2a4467000)
      /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fc2a4680000)

$ strings main | grep -i malloc | head -20  
malloc
malloc@GLIBC_2.2.5
```

---

In simple words, any project that knows its memory requirements and is certain that a general-purpose allocator might not be able to fulfill it, is almost certain to have it's own userspace dynamic memory allocator.

This writeup aims to be a complete description of glibc-malloc, which is the default general-purpose, userspace dynamic memory allocator on GNU Linux.

---

Before we dive into the details, I want to acknowledge the problems I have incurred while writing this document and the way I have dealt with them.

# The Problems

**Problem0: The original source code is always receiving changes by contributors and maintainers. As a result, it is not formatted for readability.**
  - To solve this, I have formatted the source code and all the code snippets quote the formatted source. The logic remains untouched.**
  - The original source: [sourceware.org](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=malloc/arena.c;hb=HEAD)
  - The formatted source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/aggrawal-ankur/glibc-malloc-explore/blob/main/formatted-malloc.c)

---

**Problem1: Circular dependency.**
  - To explain A, B is required. To explain B, C is required. To explain C, A is required.
  - When this happens, I try to find a natural starting point. If there isn't one, I use a forward declaration, which explains the dependency chain on surface and then I dive into it.

---

**Problem2: A concept can't be explained fully in the moment.**
  - I simply acknowledge it and ensure that the concept is properly explained later and the explanation is not hidden or buried under paragraphs.

**Problem3: The use of KB/MB quantities.**
  - The International System of Units (SI) and many hardware manufacturers (for hard drives and SSDs) use the decimal system, where quantities are based in decimal system. For ex: 1MB is 10<sup>6</sup> bytes.
  - But computers operate with binary numbers system. According to the IEC standards established in 1998, MB should be strictly 10<sup>6</sup> bytes and MiB should be 2<sup>20</sup> bytes.
  - In computing context, MB/KiB quantities are used when it actually implies MiB/KiB.
  - This document strictly adheres to the **IEC 80000-13 standard**.

# Scope and Reproducibility

It is a common pitfall to assume the `glibc` running on a standard Linux distribution (like Ubuntu or Fedora) is identical to the upstream source code hosted by the GNU Project. Distributions prioritize stability. They often "freeze" older glibc versions and apply custom backports, security patches, and compiler flags.

If you attempt to follow this guide using your host OS's default `malloc`, you will likely encounter mismatched source code line numbers and legacy structures that have been phased out of modern upstream code.

This writeup completely focuses on the upstream glibc-malloc, maintained by the GNU project. Because it is an active project, receiving updates all the time, this writeup is anchored at a stable release, called **glibc-2.43** (the current release-tag), which was released on **January 23, 2026**.

---

To ensure **100% reproducibility**, we will setup a lab environment using Docker.
  - **Base Image:** `debian:trixie`.
  - **glibc-version:** glibc-2.43
  - **Commit-id as per the release tag:** `f762ccf84f122d1354f103a151cba8bde797d521`
  - **Commit details:** [sourceware.org](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=f762ccf84f122d1354f103a151cba8bde797d521) 

**Step1:** Clone this repository on your system.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aggrawal-ankur/systems-dives.git    /repo
```

**Step2:** Use the Dockerfile in `./glibc-malloc/` to setup the container image.
```bash
cd /repo/glibc-malloc/
sudo docker build -t glibc-exp-img .
```

**Step3:** Setup a container using the custom image.
```bash
sudo docker run -it --name explore-glibc  glibc-exp-img:latest bash
```

**Step4:** The `/experiment-dir/` is where all the source code for the experiments is. It also contains build scripts to ensure seamless setup of the experiments.

**Step5:** To confirm the build succeeded:
```bash
$ /opt/glibc-2.43/lib/libc.so.6 --version

Let's start with the groundwork.

# Groundwork (Incomplete)

All the virtual memory is released by the kernel. The kernel releases memory in pages.

Modern Linux distributions have 4 KiB pages. Therefore, the least possible memory the kernel can release is 4096 bytes.

But a process's requirement's are arbitrary. This creates a gap, which is bridged by a "userspace dynamic memory allocator" program.

The allocator requests pages from the kernel, carves them into pieces and allocate to the process.

The allocator has to track the memory it has requested from the kernel, so that it can be returned later. This includes tracking the total pool of available memory, the allocated pieces of memory, and the pieces the process has "freed".

To track memory, the allocator has to manage a bookkeeping. The bookkeeping strategy is what that fundamentally distinguishes two allocators.

This writeup explores how glibc-malloc manages this bookkeeping.


TO BE CONTINUED


# Chunk Description

When malloc is called, the allocator carves a piece of dynamic memory, attaches some bookkeeping and returns it to the process. This bookkeeping is kept in a structure called `malloc_chunk`.

***A chunk is a piece of metadata associated with a portion of dynamic memory.*** But when we say "a chunk of memory", it refers to the *chunk metadata* and the *dynamic memory* together.

This metadata sits right before the payload memory, like this:
```
metadata payload
         ^
         pointer returned to the process
```

---

The layout of this chunk is:
```c
struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T       mchunk_prev_size;
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T       mchunk_size;

  struct malloc_chunk*  fd;
  struct malloc_chunk*  bk;

  struct malloc_chunk*  fd_nextsize;
  struct malloc_chunk*  bk_nextsize;
};
```

The authors have acknowledged that this layout is "misleading". Line 1082.
```
/*
  This struct declaration is misleading (but accurate and necessary).
  It declares a "view" into memory allowing access to necessary
  fields at known offsets from a given base. See explanation below.
*/
```
But in my view, the layout is well-reasoned but the reasoning is not documented properly, which makes it complicated to understand. The following is my attempt to make that reasoning visible.

Let's start with understanding each field in malloc_chunk.

## Layout Description

The **allocation size** is divided into **small** and **large** based on a threshold. Therefore, we have two types of chunks based on **size**: small chunks and large chunks.

A chunk can exist in two states: **in-use** and **free**.
  - **In-use chunks** (both small and large) are self-managed and require nothing other than the usual chunk metadata.
  - **Free chunks** require extra bookkeeping as they can be reused in servicing future malloc requests. Small free chunks and large free chunks are managed differently.

---

Based on the information above, the allocator has 3 chunk states to manage.
  1. **In-use chunks**: chunks the process is actively using (both small and large).
  2. **Small free chunks**: small chunks the process has freed.
  3. **Large free chunks**: large chunks the process has freed.

Here is a high level description of how malloc_chunk is used to represent these 3 states of chunks.

`mchunk_prev_size` holds the size of the previous chunk and `mchunk_size` holds the size of the current chunk.
  - **Note1: size means (chunk_metadata + dynamic_memory).**
  - **Note2: INTERNAL_SIZE_T is discussed later in the same parent heading. For the time being, treat it like `size_t`.**
  - **Note3: The existence of mchunk_prev_size is discussed later in the same parent heading.**

---

Free chunks are managed via bins, which are "**circular doubly linked lists**". We have small bins for small chunks and large bins for large chunks.

Small bins manage free chunks of exact size classes, while large bins manage free chunks falling in specific size ranges. For example, we have:
  - a small bin of size class 80 bytes. It contains free chunks sized 80 bytes.
  - a large bin of size range [1024, 1088) bytes. It contains free chunks of sizes falling in that range, like 1024, 1040 and so on.

A small bin manage a **linked list** of free chunks using the `fd/bk` pointers in malloc_chunk.

A large bin manage two types of links among its free chunks.
  - The `fd/bk` pointers manage links between each free chunk in the bin.
  - Although a large bin manages chunks falling in a specific size range, there can be free chunks of same size as well. To link these chunks on top of the generic links, we use the `fd_nextsize/bk_nextsize` pointers.
  - For example, a large bin managing chunks in `[1024, 1088)` range had three free chunks of sizes 1024, 1056, 1024. The three chunks will be linked via fd/bk and the two 1024 bytes chunks will have an extra fd_nextsize/bk_nextsize link.

---

In simple words, ***malloc_chunk is a generic implementation, designed to provide a single interface for all the three states in which a chunk can exist.*** This is both advantageous and cumbersome.

This is the reasoning behind the layout. Let's discuss how this layout is used.

## Usage Description

**Note: For simplicity, we do all the calculations for 64-bit Linux. But the rules remains the same for 32-bit Linux. Just use 4 instead of 8.**

On 64-bit Linux, both size_t and pointers are 8-bytes wide. That means, the size of malloc_chunk is (8*6) 48 bytes. We can verify this with sizeof as well. Create a c file, copy the definition, create an instance and use `sizeof()`.

malloc_chunk being a generic implementation is advantageous as it allows all the three 3 states of a chunk to be represented by a single struct definition. But in reality, these 3 states require only a subset of the whole implementation.
  1. mchunk_prev_size and mchunk_size are necessary in all the cases.
  2. In an in-use chunk, the four pointers aren't useful.
  3. In a small free chunk, fd/bk are required and fd_nextsize/bk_nextsize aren't useful.
  4. In a large free chunk, everything is required.

Therefore, we need to use malloc_chunk such that,
  - fd/bk/fd_nextsize/bk_nextsize remain garbage in an in-use chunk, and
  - fd_nextsize/bk_nextsize remain garbage in a small free chunk.

We have two ways to use malloc_chunk.
  - **Method1:** Set the required members appropriately and the not required ones NULL.
  - **Method2:** Only set the required members and leave the rest.

Let's calculate how these methods perform for an in-use chunk.

In method1, we have to allocate full 48 bytes for the metadata, followed by the payload memory. This wastes 24 bytes per in-use chunk, regardless of small or large. Visually:
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| prev_size | mchunk_size | fd | bk | fd_nextsize | bk_nextsize |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  ^
                                                                  Dynamic memory starts here
```

In method2, only the initial 16 bytes in the metadata struct are usable, followed by the payload memory. Visually:
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| prev_size | mchunk_size | fd | bk | fd_nextsize | bk_nextsize |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                            ^
                            Dynamic memory starts here
```
  - Method2 prevents the wastage of the trailing 24 bytes.
  - Those fields still exist, but are garbage.

Method2 is how glibc does it.

---

**Important Note**

As someone new to this, the design is not very beginner-friendly. If you can't understand it in your first attempt, remember this, I've invested weeks to understand every part of glibc-malloc, fighting this design. The document you are reading is a result of multiple rewrites.

A lot of times, we prevent ourselves from understanding the author's design because, we think that the problem should be solved in a certain different way. This is completely an unconscious act, which is why we are not aware of it.

To improve yourself, you can try this.
  - Acknowledge the author's design even if you have to do it against your will.
  - Write your design on a paper or in your IDE.
  - Contradict your design with the author's design and notice which performs better.

Either this act will make the author's design clearer, or you'll end up finding a better one. Either way, it's a win.

---

This is how a single malloc_chunk is used. But a standard Linux process calls malloc and free several times. This repeated allocation-deallocation fragments the memory and creates a problem for the allocator.

## The Problem: Fragmentation

***When memory is allocated-deallocated multiple times, it creates gaps of "unused memory" in the address space.***

This increases the pressure on physical memory because, the freed chunks are still backed by physical memory but not utilized by the process. The only way to reduce this pressure is to reallocate the freed chunks, which entirely depends on the process asking for a size which is available as a free chunk.

The fragmented memory can exist in two layouts, depending on the malloc-free sequence.
  1. In-use and free chunks in an alternating sequence, like this: {...., in-use, free, in-use, free, ....}
  2. Multiple free chunks adjacent to each other, like this: {...., in-use, free, free, in-use, ....}

Suppose two chunks of 48 bytes were freed. Now we have 96 bytes of memory which can be reused. The next malloc request asked for 96 bytes. Can we reuse the 96 bytes? No. Because, those 96 bytes are not contiguous. That is fragmentation in layout1.

Suppose two adjacent chunks, each of size 48 bytes, were freed and the next malloc request asked for 96 bytes. Can we reuse these 96 bytes? NO. Because, the memory is contiguous yet fragmented across two chunks. That is fragmentation in layout2.

---

The allocator can't do anything about the fragmentation in layout1. But the allocator can manage layout2 fragmentation to some extent. Take this:
  - The probability of the process asking for another 48 bytes bytes chunk might be less, but the probability of asking a size which falls in the range of 48-96 bytes is definitely higher.
  - But this is possible only when the two adjacent free chunks are coalesced, making one big block of free memory. Basically, converting layout2 memory to layout1 memory.

To implement coalescing, we need two things.
  1. A way to identify if the next/prev chunk is free.
  2. If the next/prev chunk is free, we need a way to reach that chunk from the current chunk.

A computer scientist and mathematician named **Donald Knuth** has discussed multiple strategies to manage dynamic memory. One of these strategies describe a way to embed coalescing support directly in the chunk metadata. It is discussed in his book *The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms*, paragraph 4, page 440. It is called, **the boundary tag method**.

The authors of this allocator have implemented the same strategy. Let's dive into coalescing.

## Coalescing

Coalescing can happen in two ways.
  1. **Forward coalescing**, where we coalesce the n<sup>th</sup> chunk with the (n+1)<sup>th</sup> chunk.
  2. **Backward coalescing**, where we coalesce the n<sup>th</sup> chunk with the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk.

Forward coalescing is simple to implement. Just add the size of the current chunk into the pointer and we are on the next chunk. But backward coalescing is not that simple because, we don't know the size of the previous chunk.

For this reason, malloc_chunk comes with `mchunk_prev_size`. mchunk_prev_size holds the size of the previous chunk and we can use it to offset back to the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk.

Now we need a way to find if the next/prev chunk is free. To do this, we use mchunk_size. Let's understand how.

---

### The second use of 'mchunk_size'

We know that `malloc()` returns a memory which can store the largest fundamental type supported by the ISO C standard.

The largest type in both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures is twice the maximum addressable width, i.e. `double` (8 bytes) on 32-bit and `long double` (16 bytes) on 64-bit.

That means, the size is always a multiple of 8, regardless of the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). That means, the lower 3 bits in mchunk_size are always 0 (or better, **unused**).

We can use these bits of mchunk_size to store state information. It does change the size value, but we can mask the lower 3 bits to get the actual size.

Here is a description of these bits.

| Bit # | Bit Name | State | Description |
| :---: | :------- | :---- | :---------- |
| 0 | PREV_INUSE (P) | **0** (clear) | The (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk is free and the prev_size of the n<sup>th</sup> chunk stores the size of the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk. |
| | | **1** (set) | The (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk is in-use and the prev_size of the n<sup>th</sup> chunk doesn't store the size of the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> chunk. |
| 1 | IS_MMAPPED (M) | **0** (clear) | 
| | | **1** (set) | 
| 2 | NON_MAIN_ARENA (A) | **0** (clear) | The chunk belongs to the main arena. |
| | | **1** (set) | The chunk belongs to a non-main arena. |

---

Right now, only the 0th bit concerns us. The remaining two bits are discussed later.

Now we can implement coalescing through the boundary tag method.

---

### The Boundary Tag Method

***Boundary tag method is a dynamic memory management technique, where the size is stored both in the head and the tail of the chunk.***

We can notice a problem here. Boundary tag method suggest to have metadata before and after the payload memory. `malloc_chunk` compensates for what comes before the payload memory, what compensates for the trailing size field?

If we create a separate struct, like `malloc_chunk_trail` and put it after the payload memory, that creates bookkeeping havoc.

How about putting another size field in the front of malloc_chunk and use it as a property of the previous chunk?
  - We don't have to create a new metadata struct.
  - The first chunk's prev_size would be a waste, as nothing exist before it. But we are ready for that tradeoff.
  - There will be some sort of dummy chunk in the end to compensate for the last malloced chunk.

The layout would look something like this:
```
Structurally -> [ Chunk1                                     ] [ Chunk2                                     ] [ Dummy Chunk                                ]
                ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
                | prev_s | chunk_s | fd | bk | fd_ns | bk_ns | | prev_s | chunk_s | fd | bk | fd_ns | bk_ns | | prev_s | chunk_s | fd | bk | fd_ns | bk_ns |
                ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
Functionally ->          [ Chunk1                                       ] [ Chunk2                                     ]
```

***The mchunk_prev_size of the n<sup>th</sup> chunk is "by-use" a part of the (n-1)<sup>th</sup>chunk. Structurally, it is still a part of the n<sup>th</sup> chunk.*** This is boundary tag method in implementation.

-- **Important Note** --

***Again, as someone new to this, the design is not beginner-friendly at all. If you can't understand it in your first attempt, don't worry. What you are reading is months of work and a result of multiple rewrites.***

***I don't how long it will take you to understand it, but it took me more than a month worth of efforts to understand this design. Even after that, I understood the implementation of boundary tag method wrong. After that, I corrected myself.***

***Therefore, give yourself time.***

---

At this point, we completely understand the existence of each field in malloc_chunk, but we still feel empty. To fill that void, we have to understand the last piece in the puzzle.

## The Size Model

Everything in glibc-malloc is directly or indirectly connected with size. Therefore, the allocator has a size model to work with "size" efficiently.

The size model is described using macros. It contains two types of macros.
  1. Macros which resolve to certain numeric values.
  2. Macros that are named blocks of code.

The reason preprocessing is preferred over inlining, **in some scenarios**, is that, modern compilers are intelligent due to decades of compiler research. But optimization techniques like **function inlining** were in a complicated state in the early days.
  - The compilers did support inlining, but it was limited to a single translation unit and not as aggressive as we see it today.
  - Even when C99 formally introduced `inline`, it was still a hint, not a guarantee.

As a result, preprocessing was the only native option for the programmers to achieve similar effects.

Another reason macros are still advantageous (in some scenarios) is that inlining is not a simple copy-paste. 
  - The compiler has to understand the overall situation to inline a function such that everything works in harmony.
  - On the other hand, preprocessing is a simple copy-paste routine with ZERO runtime overhead.

The size model is about making the **request size** usable as per the bookkeeping process.

The first thing we need to understand is the allocator's choice for receiving the request size.

### The use of size_t

malloc() takes a size (in bytes) as its argument.

Each data type has a maximum addressable limit. We need a type which can contain the largest addressable value in an architecture. The answer is `size_t`.

***`size_t` is a guarantee from the C standard to be an "unsigned integer data type", which is exactly as wide as the "pointer type" in an architecture, taking the platform's data model in account. In simple words, size_t is a data type which is wide enough to contain the largest addressable value in an architecture.***

| Arch | size_t |
| :--- | :----- |
| 32-bit Linux | 4 bytes |
| 64-bit Linux | 8 bytes |

***`size_t` and the clever use of preprocessing is the basis of an architecture-agnostic implementation.***

---

But size_t is not used directly. It is masked with a type definition.
```c
#define INTERNAL_SIZE_T  size_t
```
This makes `size_t` a tunable parameter.

***A parameter whose value can be tweaked at compile-time is called a tunable parameter (or, a tunable).*** There are multiple such parameters provided for the programmers to customize malloc to their needs.

size_t being a tunable creates a third possibility, where pointers are 8 bytes and INTERNAL_SIZE_T is 4 bytes wide. But this looks counterintuitive to the definition of size_t.

In certain IoT and embedded system configurations, the architecture is modern (64-bit) with memory constraints. Tweaking INTERNAL_SIZE_T to 4 does two things.
  1. The metadata size per in-use chunk is shrunk by half, reducing the overall memory footprint. With INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4, mchunk_prev_size and mchunk_size size 4 bytes each, totaling to 8 bytes.
  2. The maximum request size is reduced drastically to ~4 GiB of virtual memory.

Tuning INTERNAL_SIZE_T is not problematic because, we use size_t to store a size, not an address. The tradeoff is also explicit and acceptable provided the constraints.

Also, INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 doesn't create possibility for padding bytes in the struct as each member is naturally aligned to its own width given the layout order.

---

To summarize, there are the three configurations the allocator must handle.

| Config # | size_t width | Pointer width |
| :------- | :----------- | :------------ |
| 1 | 4 bytes | 4 bytes |
| 2 | 8 bytes | 8 bytes |
| 3 | 4 bytes | 8 bytes |

---

Now we are set to explore the macros that resolve to a numerical value.

---

### Macro #1 -> SIZE_SZ

It is the width of size_t on the target machine's architecture.
```c
/* The corresponding word size. */
#define SIZE_SZ  (sizeof(INTERNAL_SIZE_T))
```

| Arch   | SIZE_SZ |
| :---   | :------ |
| 32-bit | 4 bytes |
| 64-bit | 8 bytes |

---

### Macro #2 -> CHUNK_HDR_SZ

It stands for "chunk header size", which refers to the metadata bytes that sit at the beginning of an in-use chunk i.e, "mchunk_prev_size and mchunk_size".
```c
#define CHUNK_HDR_SZ    (2 * SIZE_SZ)
```

| Arch   | CHUNK_HDR_SZ |
| :---   | :----------- |
| 32-bit | 8 bytes |
| 64-bit | 16 bytes |

---

**Note: It refers to the structural overhead, not the functional overhead. Because, if it were functional, we wouldn't have count mchunk_prev_size, as it is a property of the previous chunk.**

---

### Macro #3 -> MIN_CHUNK_SIZE

It is the size of the "structurally" smallest possible chunk in an architecture.
```c
#define MIN_CHUNK_SIZE    offsetof(struct malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize)
```

`offsetof` is an ANSI C macro, defined in `stddef.h`, used to determine the byte offset of a specific member from the beginning of its parent structure.

Let's derive it manually on 64-bit.
```
  0-7 bytes -> mchunk_prev_size
 8-15 bytes -> mchunk_size
16-23 bytes -> fd
24-31 bytes -> bk
32-39 bytes -> fd_nextsize
40-47 bytes -> bk_nextsize
```
So, MIN_CHUNK_SIZE would be 32 on 64-bit.

| Config # | MIN_CHUNK_SIZE |
| :------- | :------------- |
| 32-bit   | 16 bytes |
| 64-bit   | 32 bytes |
| INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 | 24 bytes |

---

### Macro #4 -> MALLOC_ALIGNMENT

It defines the minimum alignment for in-use chunks.
```c
#define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT  (                   \
  (2 * SIZE_SZ) < __alignof__(long double)    \
  ? __alignof__(long double)                  \
  : 2 * SIZE_SZ
)
```

`__alignof__` is an operator that returns the alignment requirement of a data type (in bytes).

| Arch   | \_\_alignof__(long double) |
| :---   | :------------------------- |
| 32-bit |  4 bytes |
| 64-bit | 16 bytes |

The macro becomes:
```c
// 32-bit (size_t=4)
MALLOC_ALIGNMENT == (8 < 4)  ?  4  :  8  == 8

// 64-bit (size_t=8)
MALLOC_ALIGNMENT == (16 < 8)  ?  16  :  16  == 16
```

In both the cases, the alignment is kept twice of the maximum addressable width. This is because malloc is a general purpose allocator. It is unaware of what the caller will store in the returned memory. So it ensures that the returned memory is aligned to all the fundamental types the C standard supports. This is in accord to what we have discussed in the mchunk_size section.

However, it's real importance is in that third configuration, where pointers are 8 bytes and INTERNAL_SIZE_T is 4 bytes wide.
```c
MALLOC_ALIGNMENT = (2 * 4) < 16  ?  16  :  16
```

Notice how the alignment is decided based on the largest fundamental type in the architecture, not the value of INTERNAL_SIZE_T.

---

| Config # | MALLOC_ALIGNMENT |
| :------- | :--------------- |
| 32-bit   |  8 bytes |
| 64-bit   | 16 bytes |
| INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 | 16 bytes |

---

### Macro #5 -> MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK

MALLOC_ALIGNMENT is a power-of-2 value and MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK is the bit mask of it.
```c
#define MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK    (MALLOC_ALIGNMENT - 1)
```

MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK has the lowest 4 bits set which are clear in MALLOC_ALIGNMENT.
```bash
# 64-bit
MALLOC_ALIGNMENT  = 16 = 0001 0000
MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK = 15 = 0000 1111
```

It is used in a variety of bitwise operations.
  1. Check if a size/address is aligned to the alignment boundary (the lower 4-bits in the addr/size must be all 0 to yield a zero against all 1s of the bit-mask).
     ```c
     (addr & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) == 0  :=  aligned
     (addr & MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) != 0  :=  misaligned
     ```
  2. Round a size/address up to the alignment boundary.
     ```c
     -> (size + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK
     -> (34 + 15) & ~15
     -> 49 & -16
     -> 48
     ```
  3. Round a size/address down to the alignment boundary.
     ```c
     -> size & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK
     -> 41 & ~15
     -> 32
     ```
---

| Config # | MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK |
| :------- | :---------------- |
| 32-bit   |  7 |
| 64-bit   | 15 |
| INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 | 15 |

---

### Macro #6 -> MINSIZE

It is the smallest size that malloc supports.
```c
#define MINSIZE    (unsigned long)( \
  ( (MIN_CHUNK_SIZE + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK)
)
```

We know that an in-use chunk requires (2 * SIZE_SZ) bytes for storing metadata and when it is freed, it requires (2 * ptr_width) bytes to manage fd/bk. That totals to 16 bytes on 32-bit and 32 bytes on 64-bit.

In INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4, the metadata overhead is 24 bytes, but 24 is not aligned to the alignment boundary (16-div), so we round it up to the next boundary, making MINSIZE 32 bytes.

| Config # | MINSIZE |
| :------- | :------ |
| 32-bit   | 16 bytes |
| 64-bit   | 32 bytes |
| INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 | 32 bytes |

---

In the MIN_CHUNK_SIZE section, we have seen that it is the size of the structurally smallest chunk possible in an architecture. MINSIZE is the actual smallest chunk size possible in an architecture after adding alignment constraints.

The values happen to be equal in the first two configurations because the struct layout aligned with the alignment constraints. That broke with INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4.

---

### Macro #7 -> request2size

This macro is responsible for enforcing the size model on the requested size.

**It is the closest we can "statically" see the boundary tag method in implementation.**

It is defined as:
```c
#define request2size(req)    (                     \
  (req + SIZE_SZ + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK < MINSIZE)    \
  ? MINSIZE                                        \
  : (req + SIZE_SZ + MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK) & ~MALLOC_ALIGN_MASK    \
)
```

Let's take an example on 64-bit architecture: `malloc(20)`.
  - (20 + 8 + 15) < 32; 43 < 32; Therefore, the false case is chosen.
  - aligned_size = (20 + 8 + 15) & ~15
  - aligned_size = 43 & ~15 = 32.
  - In these 32 bytes, we need 20 bytes of usable memory. That leaves us 12 bytes of memory for metadata. But metadata requires 16 bytes of space. We are short on 4 bytes. Visually:
    ```
          8           8         8     8
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    | prev_size | mchunk_size | fd | bk | fd_nextsize | bk_nextsize |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                ^ ptr_to_mem
    ```
  - But in the boundary tag discussion, we have agreed on a dummy chunk in the end. That would make the situation this:
    ```
          8           8         8     8
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    | prev_size | mchunk_size | fd | bk | fd_nextsize | bk_nextsize |
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                              8
                                        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                        | prev_size | mchunk_size | fd | bk | fd_nextsize | bk_nextsize |
                                        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                ^ ptr_to_mem
    ```
  - That dummy chunk has a name. **The top chunk** is a special chunk that sits after all the malloced chunk. We'll talk about it later in detail.

So, request2size deliberately leaves out SIZE_SZ bytes of memory in every chunk because the payload memory of a chunk is allowed to "spill over" and occupy the prev_size of the next chunk. For the last allocated chunk, the prev_size is provided by the top chunk.

---

### Macro #8 -> chunk2mem

`chunk2mem` takes a pointer to a chunk, casts it to `char*` (for pointer arithmetic) and add "chunk header size" to it.
```c
#define chunk2mem(p)    ( (void*) ((char*)(p) + CHUNK_HDR_SZ) )
```

This will land us at the `fd` field in the struct, where the payload memory starts in an in-use chunk, just the way we have discussed.

---

***That's what the author probably meant when he said, "This struct declaration is misleading (but accurate and necessary)."***


Now that we understand chunks, let's explore how freed chunks are managed, i.e, **the bookkeeping process**.

---

# The Bookkeeping System, Part 0: The Problem

The bookkeeping system sits at the core of glibc-malloc. It is the framework based on which the whole malloc-free pathways are stacked. It is probably the most challenging piece to write because, it is unnecessarily tiring.

In the chunk description section, what the author flagged as "misleading, but accurate and necessary" was simply a lack of proper documentation of the design decisions. What makes writing the bookkeeping section a challenging pursuit is the presence of an unfathomable amount of inconsistencies that simply don't make sense.

As we will explore, we will find pretty interesting, or I should say, disturbing annotations. Those annotations explore the diabolical nature of how the codebase was managed.

There are annotations which don't align with the implementation. You might argue that someone updated something and forgot. *No one realized it in the span of more than two decades?* Then there are two annotations about a single topic which don't converge. That alone is enough to break your mind because, it is supposed that two annotations explaining the same topic will be coherent. *How can something exist in two different states at the same time?* It can only exist in one and we are left finding it out ourselves.

There is literally an annotation that acknowledges the rapidly advancing ecosystem.
```
The above was written in 2001. Since then the world has changed a lot.
```
- The moment this annotation was written is the moment the author and the maintainers lost the excuse that "we can't invest in updating the annotations which are present only for one reason, to explain what is happening."
- If something was changed in the implementation, the annotation(s) that accounts for it must be updated too. It shouldn't get complicated than that.

glibc adopted dlmalloc@2.7.0 in the glibc-2.3 release. dlmalloc itself confirms that it is 64-bit compatible, but many annotations were never updated to reflect the 64-bit realty.

Not updating the annotations was a deliberate choice that the author and the maintainers made.

Everything points to the fact that these inconsistencies exist out of pure laziness. There is simply no reason for them to exist. But no one was bothered to do the boring work for updating the theoretical model.

You don't have to believe me. I will show the facts and you can independently decide whether the writer is talking "out of thin air" or "with everything grounded in reality as per the source".

---

The situation is really tiring and it is in the best of our interest to avoid carrying all the three configs together. We will stick to 64-bit and later apply our understanding to the other two configs.

To reduce cognitive load as much as it is possible, I have divided the exploration into three headings that build on each other.
  1. **The implementation of bins data structure**: Here we will explore a lookalike of `malloc_chunk` which was not properly documented and this time, the author chose to waive-off by saying "the repositioning trick".
  2. **Static analysis bins[]**: Here we will statically explore the state of bins and find all the inconsistencies.
  3. **Dynamic analysis of bins[]**: Here will verify all the facts at runtime and build the final structure of bins.
  4. Extending our understanding to build the model of the other two configs as well.

Although I believe that understanding bins will suffice, but I'll still give proper historical evidence in the end to prove that situation started worse, it didn't got worse overtime.

---

# The Bookkeeping System, Part 1: The Implementation Of Bins

***A bin is a data structure, based on "circular doubly linked list", which is used to manage free chunks. Another name for a bin is "free list".***

Conceptually, we have three class of bins: **smallbins** for small chunks, **largebins** for large chunks and a bin to hold chunks temporarily, called **the unsorted bin**. Because these are just names given to the same backend, we have two choices.
  1. Implement three different variables for each bin type.
  2. Implement one variable that has pointers to all the bins.

Therefore, at the implementation level, we have **only one** data structure, containing pointers to all the bins, i.e, an array.

There are multiple ways to implement this array. To understand which one is the best, we have to understand how a "doubly circular linked list" works.

## Premise

1. If you have taken any data structures course, you might be familiar with linked lists, but familiarity alone is not enough to understand this implementation.
2. Data structure questions are generally solved in object oriented languages like C++/Java (this is what I have seen on the internet), which are completely different from C's procedural approach.
3. I have tried to find implementations on the internet, which I can link here to save myself some time and efforts, but I couldn't find a single of them that satisfies the requirements.

For these reasons, I have created 4 linked list implementations in the [./linked-list-code/](./linked-list-code/) directory. This is helpful in two ways.
  - Those who feel rusty about their understanding can quickly visit the code to strengthen it. They don't have to waste time on the internet.
  - As a writer, I can be sure that my reader and I have the same base model of the problem. We can, and should, differ in the later ideas, but our foundation is the same.

**Note: Reading them is not a precursor. I have mentioned when it is required.**

Let's revise our understanding of double circular linked lists.

## Single D.C linked list

A double circular linked list has **head** and **tail** pointers to create circularity. We have two ways to implement it.
  1. Managing the head and tail pointers individually, like this:
     ```c
     int main(void){
       struct Node* head;
       struct Node* tail;
     }
     ```
  2. A distinct struct, like this:
     ```c
     struct List{
       struct* Node head;
       struct* Node tail;
     };
     ```

While method1 is obvious, method2 provides an intuitive abstraction.

In the end, both the methods are identical and based on the tutor's choice, you might have seen both. I have seen both, especially the first one in the cpp space.The [double circular list implementation](./linked-list-code/1-simple-dll.c) is based on method2. Please read it.

## A collection of D.C linked lists

The `bins` data structure is a collection of bins. Regardless of what we have chosen in the previous implementation, we have two options. Either we implement the pointers manually, or we create an array of them. Both the options are demonstrated below.

### Method1: List*
---

Manage multiple `List*` manually.
```c
int main(void){
  struct List* l1;
  struct List* l2;
}
```

Create an array of `List*`.
```c
int main(void){
  unsigned long listCount = 10;
  struct List* lptrs[listCount];
}
```

### Method2: Node*
---

1. Manage the head/tail pointers individually for each list.
```c
int main(void){
  struct Node* l1_head;
  struct Node* l1_tail;
  struct Node* l2_head;
  struct Node* l2_tail;
}
```

2. Create an array of `Node*`.
```c
int main(void){
  unsigned int listCount = 10;
  struct Node* listHeaders[listCount*2];
}
```

---

Managing pointers individually is tiresome and error-prone, while managing an array of pointers is semantically clean and has indexing benefits. We have an array-based implementation for both the options. Please read the [list_ptr-array.c](./linked-list-code/2-list_ptr-array.c) and [node_ptr-array.c](./linked-list-code/3-node_ptr-array.c) implementations.

Now we have two worthy candidates for implementing `bins[]`. glibc-malloc uses the `Node*` implementation. To understand why the `List*` implementation is not used, we have to understand why `Node*` is used.

## The Node* array implementation

So far, we have an array of `Node*` elements, representing the head/tail pointers of lists.
  1. The head/tail pointers point to the first and the last nodes in a list.
  2. The head/tail pointers act as artificial **ends** for a list while the next/prev pointers [per node] create circularity.
  3. An empty list has the head/tail pointers NULL.

The push/delete functions are probably the most important operations. They have to run multiple times. Right now, our push/delete logic is simple, but lacks efficiency.
  - The logic is divided into *single node list* and *multiple nodes list*, and the bottleneck is right at the start of the algorithm.
  - For every list, we have to check if it is a singular list, which is inefficient because, it creates a branch in the happy path. The CPU has no option but to evaluate the special case every single time, making the code inefficient.

We need a solution that makes eliminates this "special casing" and make the the push/delete logic branchless. Let's start thinking.

## How to make the push/delete logic branchless?

The listHeaders in `node_ptr-array.c` are fixed to the head/tail nodes in the list. If the list is empty, they are NULL.

That's how a single list look likes:
```c
head<->node1<->tail
```

When a node is added to it, let's say, on the tail, it becomes:
```c
head<->node1<->node2<->tail
```

When we print the list, we anchor the start/end with the head/tail pointers; we don't rely on the next/prev pointers because, they maintain circularity. When the list is empty, they must be set NULL. This makes the head/tail pointers sentinel beings. They don't directly participate in the push/delete logic but makes it depend on them.

***The solution is about eliminating this "special casing" and make the listHeaders participate in the process completely. They must not be treated specially when the list is empty.*** 

The question is how? ***We have to change how we perceive these listHeaders.***

## Finding the solution

The listHeaders[] is defined as:
```c
struct Node{
  int data;
  struct Node* next;
  struct Node* prev;
}

unsigned long listCount = 10;
struct Node* listHeaders[listCount*2];
```
**Reminder: The struct will have 4 padding bytes after the `data` field to keep alignment.**

We have to find which headers correspond to which list and the calculation depends on how we count the lists.
  - In case of 0-based indexing, list0's headers will be listHeaders[0] and listHeaders[1]; list1's headers will be listHeaders[2] and listHeaders[3]. So, the headers for the nth list will be `listHeaders[i*2]` and `listHeaders[(i*2)+1]`.
  - In case of 1-based indexing, list1's headers will be listHeaders[0] and listHeaders[1]; list2's headers will be listHeaders[2] and listHeaders[3]; So, the headers for the nth list will be `listHeaders[(i-1)*2]` and `listHeaders[((i-1)*2)+1]`.

Either way, the logic is remains the same.

**Note: You don't have to keep the formulas active in your mind. Just be aware of the situation.**

---

If we ask "*what actually participates in the push/delete process*", the answer would be, **nodes**. Does that mean, *to make the headers participate in the process, the headers must be nodes themselves?* Yes. The question is how!

***Moments like these, where you have a rough idea of the outcome you need, and you need to find the process that can lead to it, but you have absolutely no substrate to think upon, one way to deal with this is to ask as many questions as you can, related or unrelated. Eventually, you will find the right one. This is also applicable when the answer to a question is a question itself. Keep asking questions and eventually, the recursion will end.*** So, let's ask some questions.
  - If headers need to be nodes themselves, what are headers right now? They are pointers to nodes, not nodes themselves.
  - If the headers are nodes themselves, *are there distinct nodes for both the headers?*, or, *there is one node that contains both the headers?*
  -  In either of the cases, what the fields of this/these fake nodes will contain? The `data` field will be garbage for obvious reasons. What about the next/prev fields?
  - If we have two fake nodes, the head fake node's next would probably point to the real head node and the tail fake node's prev would point to the real tail node. What happens to the prev and next of the head and the tail fake nodes?
  - Does the head fake node's prev point to the real tail node and the tail fake node's next points to the real head node in the list? If that is true, we will end up with two identical fake nodes. Correct?
  - Does that mean, *we need only one fake node, whose next/prev will point to the real head/tail nodes in the list?* Something like:
    ```c
    ....fake_node<->new_node<->exist_node<->fake_node....
    ```

**Congratulations**. That's the answer. ***We need a fake node whose next/prev point to the head/tail nodes in the list.***

---

Now the rough image of the outcome is crystal clear. Let's think about how we will get to it.

## Implementing the solution

Let's take an example. The numbers represent 64-bit addresses.
```
1000 :: &listHeaders[0]
1008 :: &listHeaders[1]
```

If we need a fake node, such that, it's next/prev align with the addresses that point to the head/tail nodes in a list represented by the above headers, where should the fake node start in the memory? *The answer is 992.*

That means, the fake node for the above list headers can be obtained this way:
```c
// struct Node* fake_node = (Node*) ( (char*)(&listHeaders[0]) -8);
struct Node* fake_node = (Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[0])-8);

fake_node->next = listHeaders[0];
fake_node->prev = listHeaders[1];
```

To obtain a fake node suitable for the nth list, we can do it this way:
```c
// 0-based indexing
struct Node* fake_node = (Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[i*2])-8);

// 1-based indexing
struct Node* fake_node = (Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[(i-1)*2])-8);
```

When the list is empty, the next/prev of the fake_node will simply point to the list header itself, i.e `(Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[i*2])-8);` or the other one.

## Some concerns

We are using a negative index to offset into a valid index, at least for the 0th list. How is this legal?

An access is illegal when it doesn't align with the memory protection rights (mprotect). Right now, we are doing this on stack. If we are familiar with how the kernel maps a binary and prepares it for execution, we know that a process's stack is initialized by the kernel with a lot of stuff that comes before the main function. Therefore, we are not accessing a memory we don't own, which is why, we don't get a segfault.

*malloc_state*, which is where the bins[] is allocated, goes on the static storage, and it is not the only thing that goes there and it is not the first thing that goes there. Therefore, we are not touching an address we are not meant to.

However, we have to be cautious about this kind of pointer arithmetic as it touches a piece of memory which might hold crucial information.
  - If the arithmetic failed and we overwrite that memory, we are officially in **the undefined behavior territory**.
  - But we ensure that it doesn't happen by using that pointer only for offsetting to the right headers; we never-ever use that address to write something.

---

To complete your understanding, open the [fake-node-impl.c](./linked-list-code/4-fake-node-impl.c). You might notice it still contains the single vs multiple distinction. It is left to make the leap smooth. Just comment that block and run again. You'll not be surprised that it works. [fake-node-impl(2).c](./linked-list-code/4-fake-node-impl(2).c) contains the final version of this implementation.

---

This is what the author titled as "the repositioning trick". And I am sort of perplexed about the title.
```
  To simplify use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as 
  a malloc_chunk. This avoids special-casing for headers. But to 
  conserve space and improve locality, we allocate only the fd/bk 
  pointers of bins, and then use "repositioning tricks" to treat 
  these as the fields of a malloc_chunk*.
```

Anyways, if you have understood everything discussed so far but still feel "sort of incomplete", or sensing the absence of a conclusion, that goes like *"and this is how glibc-malloc does it with bins[]...."*, I want to say that "that conclusion is not possible here", for the time being. 

`bin_at` is the macro that operationalize this repositioning trick, which is the conclusion to this heading, but understanding it requires concepts that I have not introduced yet. Therefore, we will explore it later.

---

So to answer how `bins` are implemented, ***they are implemented as an array of bin headers of type mchunkptr (malloc_chunk\*) and "repositioning tricks" are used to find the correct bin.***

Now you know why a `List*` array is not suitable. It creates hurdles in implementing that "repositioning trick". However, a `List` array might make sense because, internally, it is just `Node*` elements. But in this case, it would simply be an abstraction that is no longer required.

# The Bookkeeping System, Part 2: Static Analysis of bins[]

The static analysis is done on two elements in the source.
  - **Annotations** are comments that never execute. Ideally, they should represent the runtime reality. But annotations are here are in a complicated state and trusting them completely is not an option.
  - **Macros** represent the real truth as they get executed.

We will try to extract "the closest runtime reality possible" from the overall description and later use that information in dynamic analysis.

**Note: There are some annotations which indicate multiple things, but to keep things clear, we will repeat those annotations instead of reading them all at once.**

## Bin counts

### Total number of bins

The total number of bins is 128, as per this annotation and macro definition.
```c
/* There are a lot of these bins (128). */

#define  NBINS  128
```

### Number of smallbins

There is no annotation for the smallbin count, and as per this macro, there are 64 smallbins.
```c
#define  NSMALLBINS  64
```

### Number of largebins

There is neither an annotation nor a macro that confirms the count of largebins directly. However, there is one annotation having a bin pyramid like structure.
```
    64 bins of size          8
    32 bins of size         64
    16 bins of size        512
     8 bins of size       4096
     4 bins of size      32768
     2 bins of size     262144
     1 bin  of size    what's left
```

Since the count of smallbins is confirmed, it is safe to assume that except the bins in the first row, every other bin is a largebin. Their count would be 63 (32+16+8+4+2+1).

64 smallbins and 63 largebins add up to 127 bins. But the total number of bins is 128.

**One bin is missing here.**

### The unsorted bin

This annotation confirms that there is only one unsorted bin, although it doesn't use the word "bin" directly.
```
The otherwise unindexable 1-bin is used to hold unsorted chunks.
```
Note: This is the kind of annotation I was talking about in the premise. It is pointing to multiple things and if we accessed them all at once, it will become frustrating quite-fast. ***Every question deserves an answer, but it must be asked at the right time.***

---

To conclude, there are 64 smallbins, 63 largebins and 1 unsorted bin. Also, there is ambiguity about 1 bin.

## The order of bins

There is no annotation that directly confirms the order of bins.Logically, if bins are manged in ascending order, which comes naturally as the size start from 0, the smallbins should come first, followed by the largebins.

We can notice that the bin pyramid has 64 bins on the top. Since the sizes are increasing top-to-bottom, it is highly likely that our assumption is correct.

What about the unsorted bin? Let's reread that unsorted bin annotation. The term "1-bin" can have two interpretations.
  1. The bin at index 1 (0-based indexing).
  2. The first bin (1-based indexing).

In either case, 1-bin would be a smallbin. If this bin is the unsorted bin, the count of smallbins is reduced to 63.

As we have no clarity about how bins are indexed, there are two possible orders:
```
0-based indexing: [smallbin, unsorted_bin, smallbins, largebins]
                      1           1          62          63

1-based indexing: [unsorted_bin, smallbins, largebins]
                        1          63          63
```

---

Have a look at this annotation.
```
Bin 0 does not exist. Bin 1 is the unordered list; if that 
would be a valid chunk size the small bins are bumped up one.
```

"Bin 0" and "Bin 1" strongly indicates the use of 0-based indexing.

"bin 0 doesn't exist" can have two interpretations.
  - Bin 0 doesn't exist **literally**? Or,
  - Bin 0 exist, but is of no function?

If bin 0 doesn't exist literally, that reduces the count of smallbins to 62.

---

Based on this information, the order of bins should be:
```
[unsorted_bin, smallbins, largebins]
      1           62         63
```

One annotation said there are "128 bins". The NBINS definition said there are "128 bins". Another annotation listed all the bins and they add up to "127", not 128. Our analysis is only able to confirm the existence of 126 smallbins. *This is what I meant when I said that "two annotations about the same topic are not converging".*

## The Questions

The analysis above raises some questions.
  - Why bin 0 doesn't exist?
  - If "bin 0" was never meant to exist, why the count is simply not 127?
  - Even if "bin 0" doesn't exist, it reduces the total number of bins by 1. What accounts for the absence of another bin?
  - Why bin 1, which is supposed to be a smallbin is [repurposed as] an unsorted bin?

This line in the annotation: *"if that would be a valid chunk size the small bins are bumped up one."* is not making sense at all.
  - Is the design non-deterministic?
  - It reads like there is a lack clarity about the size of 1-bin, which is why the annotation is asking the validity of that size as a smallbin class.

## Smallbin Size Classes

We know that smallbins manage chunks falling in specific size ranges, called "**size classes**".

There are two things about these size classes.
  1. The size of free chunks a smallbin manages (the class).
  2. The difference between two consecutive size classes.

SMALLBIN_WIDTH is the difference between two size classes.
```c
#define  SMALLBIN_WIDTH  MALLOC_ALIGNMENT
```

MALLOC_ALIGNMENT is (2*SIZE_SZ) in an architecture. For 64-bit, it is 16 bytes. Therefore, the gap between two smallbins is 16 bytes on 64-bit.

To obtain the actual size classes, we have to start from a size which represents the current size class and add SMALLBIN_WIDTH to it to obtain the next size class. The starting point is the question.

NSMALLBINS is the total count and this represents the number of times we have add SMALLBIN_WIDTH to obtain the last size class.

This annotation exposes the upper bound for smallbins in 32-bit architecture.
```
Bins for (sizes < 512 bytes) contain chunks of all
the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart. Larger bins
are approximately logarithmically spaced.
```
  - **How we know it is for 32-bit?** SMALLBIN_WIDTH is 8 bytes here.
  - **How we are so confident that it is talking about smallbins?** Because the next sentence specifically talks about largebin spacing.

We have this macro, which confirms what we have discussed before.
```c
#define  SMALLBIN_CORRECTION  (MALLOC_ALIGNMENT > CHUNK_HDR_SZ)

#define  MIN_LARGE_SIZE  ((NSMALLBINS - SMALLBIN_CORRECTION) * SMALLBIN_WIDTH)
```

SMALLBIN_CORRECTION is the correction factor. Since it has visible effects only in config #3, we will discuss it there. On 32-bit and 64-bit, it is 0.

MIN_LARGE_SIZE is the size of the first largebin. On 32-bit, it is (64-0)*8, i.e 512 bytes. This converges with the annotation.

On 64-bit, MIN_LARGE_SIZE will be 1024 bytes, implying the last smallbin size class would be for MIN_LARGE_SIZE-SMALLBIN_WIDTH (1024-16), i.e 1008 bytes.

We have the last smallbin size class, the total number of smallbins, and the width of smallbins on 64-bit. With a simple for loop, running backwards, we can construct the list of smallbins. This way, we can skip the question of finding the starting point as the last number in the output will represent exactly that.

But before we do that, what should be the starting point? What should be the first smallbin size class?
  - Starting with zero is the most straightforward path? The size class 0 will contain free chunks of size 0 bytes and the subsequent size classes will be obtained by (SMALLBIN_WIDTH*i), with i=1. But wait, chunks of size 0 bytes aren't possible; zero is not a malloc-able size.
  - The next size class on 64-bit would be for 16 bytes (i.e. SMALLBIN_WIDTH\*1), which will manage chunks of size 16 bytes. But we can't start from this either, as the minimum allocatable size, i.e MINSIZE, is 32 on 64-bit, which is effectively the next size class (i.e. SMALLBIN_WIDTH\*2).
  - Basically, the first two size classes, i.e. SMALLBIN_WIDTH\*0 and SMALLBIN_WIDTH\*1 are not usable, be it 32-bit or 64-bit. That leaves us with 62 usable smallbins.

---

Let's see what we get by crawling backwards.
```py
x = 1024
for i in range(64):
  x = x-16
  print(x, end=", ")
```

The output is exactly as anticipated.
```
1008, 992, 976, 960, 944, 928, 912, 896, 880, 864, 848, 832, 816, 800, 784, 768, 752, 736, 720, 704, 688, 672, 656, 640, 624, 608, 592, 576, 560, 544, 528, 512, 496, 480, 464, 448, 432, 416, 400, 384, 368, 352, 336, 320, 304, 288, 272, 256, 240, 224, 208, 192, 176, 160, 144, 128, 112, 96, 80, 64, 48, 32, 16, 0,
  ```

***There, if there are n smallbins, only (n-2) are actually usable. Among 64 smallbins, the actual usable size classes are 62, leaving us with 62 smallbins.*** Let's revise our understanding of smallbins.
  - The reason bin 0 doesn't exist is that it has no utility.
  - Bin 1 has no utility either, but we need an unsorted bin, so we repurpose it. This way, we end up saving space for 2 pointers.
  - Notice that space-conservation is a real benefit here. If repurposing bin 1 enables the usage of two pointers which were otherwise wasted, removing bin 0 entirely can save space too, and it will make sense too, which aligns with out analysis so far.

Now we have something that explains the bin0 and bin1 situation. But it doesn't explain why the author didn't choose 62 smallbins and start directly from size class 32 and reserve a bin properly for the unsorted bin. *The question will be answered, at the right time*.

---

Let's revisit the *"if that would be a valid chunk size the small bins are bumped up one."* annotation.

We have obtained the smallbin size classes directly from the description. Was this line required in the first place? This information was well-known to the author or whoever wrote this. So I still can't understand why it was written in the first place.

---

We have answered why "bin 1" is repurposed as the unsorted bin. Also, the absence of "bin 0" might be attributed to a reduced count. The first question remains and we will answer it later.

Let's talk about spacing in largebins.

## Largebin Spacing

There is no LARGEBIN_WIDTH macro as there are different class of largebins. The largebin widths are exposed via the bin pyramid, which is again applicable to 32-bit only.
```
Larger bins are approximately logarithmically spaced.

    64 bins of size          8
    32 bins of size         64
    16 bins of size        512
     8 bins of size       4096
     4 bins of size      32768
     2 bins of size     262144
     1 bin  of size    what's left
```

The biggest problem with this pyramid is the incorrect framing of bins. We have recently explored smallbin spacing. So, ***are there 64 bins of 8 bytes, or 64 bins of size (SMALLBIN_WIDTH\*i) bytes, where i belongs to [0, 63] ?***

It is not "*n* bins of size *x* bytes". It is "*n* bins of width *x* bytes". A better version could be:
```
    64 bins of width          8
    32 bins of width         64
    16 bins of width        512
     8 bins of width       4096
     4 bins of width      32768
     2 bins of width     262144
     1 bin  of width    what's left
```

But we can do a lot better, with this table.

| Bin Classification | Count of bins | BIN_WIDTH (in bytes) | BIN_WIDTH (pow-of-2) |
| :----------------- | :------------ | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| Unsorted bin       | 1             | NA                   | NA                   |
| Smallbin           | 64            | 8                    | 2<sup>3</sup>        |
| Largebin Cat1      | 32            | 64                   | 2<sup>6</sup>        |
| Largebin Cat2      | 16            | 512                  | 2<sup>9</sup>        |
| Largebin Cat3      | 8             | 4096                 | 2<sup>12</sup>       |
| Largebin Cat4      | 4             | 32768                | 2<sup>15</sup>       |
| Largebin Cat5      | 2             | 262144               | 2<sup>18</sup>       |
| Largebin Cat6      | 1             | what's left          | ?                    |

---

**Note: BIN_WIDTH is not a macro defined in malloc.c. I am using it because it captures the idea elegantly.**

But as per our analysis of smallbins, it is incorrect and we have not done the largebin analysis yet. So, take it as a blueprint for a better pyramid. We will correct it as we gather more information.

---

The pyramid in the annotation is only applicable to 32-bit. While we can generate the 64-bit one, the problem is largebin spacing.
  - The annotation above it says that *"largebins are approximately logarithmically spaced"*. If we look at the last column, we will notice that the width of bins in each category is scaling upwards by 3 bits. That's what log-spacing is.
  - We can also notice an inconsistency here. The annotation says that "the largebins are log-spaced", but in reality, **it is the bin classes which are logarithmically spaced, not the individual bins within a class.** Within each class, bins are linearly spaced by a fixed BIN_WIDTH. Across classes, BIN_WIDTH itself scales by 2<sup>3</sup>.
  - To make this comprehensible, the term "bin classification" was introduced.
  - All this is applicable to 32-bit. On 64-bit, BIN_WIDTH would scale by 2<sup>4</sup>, which is where the problem is.

This is probably the most weird annotation I have seen.
```
// XXX It remains to be seen whether it is good to keep the widths of
// XXX the buckets the same or whether it should be scaled by a factor
// XXX of two as well.
```
  - **Note: Don't assume XXX is a placeholder for something.**

This annotation is questioning whether BIN_WIDTH should scale with the architecture. If BIN_WIDTH scaled with the architecture, we would have the following widths (in bytes): 2<sup>4</sup> (16), 2<sup>8</sup> (256), 2<sup>12</sup> (4096), 2<sup>16</sup> (65536), 2<sup>20</sup> (1,048,576: 1 MiB), and 2<sup>24</sup> (16,777,216: 16 MiB).

Now look at this annotation.
```
The bins top out around 1MB because we expect to service
large requests via mmap.
```

Again, it is applicable to 32-bit only. It acknowledges a design decision that *we wish to service "large" requests via mmap*. If BIN_WIDTH scaled with the architecture, our definition of "large" would change too.

Right now, the bins in 32-bit top out around 1 MiB. When the width scales with the architecture, the largest bin width on 64-bit is 16 MiB, and there are 2 bins in this category, and a "what's left" bin comes after it. 

The question is, are we OK to service requests in multiple MiB with sbrk? Is it worthwhile or comes with significant performance issues? Based on this, the largebin spacing annotation can be interpreted in two ways.
  1. The acknowledgement might refer to the fact that the decision was thought but never made. Maybe the author studied the implications and maybe benchmarked the implementation too and they were not satisfied with the results, so it was never included and the largebins on 64-bit scale as they scale on 32-bit. The question is worth asking that, "if the decision didn't make sense, and such scaling was not implemented, why the author chose to left this annotation? why not, simply say that the largebins on 64-bit scale with 2<sup>3</sup> only for XYZ reason"?
  2. But the track record of annotations is not that great. So taking them at face value is not generating much confidence. It might be the case that it was implemented but as it has been with many annotations, it was never updated/removed.

---

So, scale the 64-bit largebins with 2<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>4</sup> ? Since the annotations don't answer this, we will look at the implementation.

largebin_index_64(sz) is the macro for generating indices for largebins on 64-bit.
```c
#define largebin_index_64(sz)   ( \
  (((unsigned long)(sz) >>  6) <= 48) ?  48 + ((unsigned long)(sz) >> 6)  : \
  (((unsigned long)(sz) >>  9) <= 20) ?  91 + ((unsigned long)(sz) >> 9)  : \
  (((unsigned long)(sz) >> 12) <= 10) ? 110 + ((unsigned long)(sz) >> 12) : \
  (((unsigned long)(sz) >> 15) <=  4) ? 119 + ((unsigned long)(sz) >> 15) : \
  (((unsigned long)(sz) >> 18) <=  2) ? 124 + ((unsigned long)(sz) >> 18) : \
  126 \
)
```

Just by looking at the macro, we can say with surety that "the largebin width doesn't scale with the architecture". It remains 2<sup>3</sup> on 64-bit as well.

Even though we understand largebin spacing now, it is better to defer constructing the table until we explore the largebin situation completely.

---

Before we go on building the list of largebins on 64-bit, we have to understand how bin indexing works. This is where we will close a thread opened since part 1, which is, "the conclusion of part 1", how the fake node implementation is operationalized.

## Bin Indexing

We know that bins are implemented using circular doubly linked lists and to ensure efficiency in operations, a fake node implementation is used. ***Therefore, bin indexing is the process of mapping the correct bin for a size and calculating the address which can represent the fake node whose fd/bk overlap with the bin headers for that bin.***

These macros are responsible for streamlining that process.
```c
#define bin_index(sz)
#define in_smallbin_range(sz)

#define smallbin_index(sz)

#define largebin_index(sz)
#define   largebin_index_32(sz)
#define   largebin_index_32_big(sz)
#define   largebin_index_64(sz)

#define bin_at(M, i)
```

### Macro #1: bin_index(sz)
---

This macro is a high level handler that takes a size and calls the appropriate bin handler.
```c
#define bin_index(sz)    ( \
  in_smallbin_range(sz)    \
  ? smallbin_index(sz)     \
  : largebin_index(sz)     \
)
```

There is no mention of the unsorted bin as it has a dedicated macro.
```c
#define  unsorted_chunks(M)  bin_at(M, 1)
```

### Macro #2: in_smallbin_range(sz)
---

This macro takes a size and checks whether it is a valid smallbin size class. Based on the result, the size is passed to the appropriate bin handler.
```c
#define in_smallbin_range(sz)    ( \
  (unsigned long)(sz) < (unsigned long)(MIN_LARGE_SIZE) \
)
```

### Macro #3: smallbin_index(sz)
---

It is the handler for smallbins. It calculates the "index" of the bin corresponding to the size.
```c
#define smallbin_index(sz)    ( \
  ( \
    (SMALLBIN_WIDTH == 16)     \
    ? (((unsigned)(sz)) >> 4)  \
    : (((unsigned)(sz)) >> 3)  \
  ) + SMALLBIN_CORRECTION      \
)
```

For 64-bit, we are right-shifting the size by 4, which is basically division by 2<sup>4</sup>. In case of 32-bit, we divide the size by 2<sup>3</sup>. If you notice, the macro is basically dividing the size by SMALLBIN_WIDTH and adding the correction factor.

We can definitely simplify the macro this way:
```c
#define  smallbin_index(sz)  ((sz/SMALLBIN_WIDTH) + SMALLBIN_CORRECTION)
```
.... and the compiler will generate identical assembly for both at -O1 or -O2 as they are fundamentally the same thing. The reason former exist can be attributed to compiler limitations as discussed in the "preprocessing vs inlining" argument earlier.

**Notes**:
  1. As mentioned earlier, SMALLBIN_CORRECTION is 0 for 32-bit and 64-bit, and has utility in config #3 and we will discuss it there.
  2. There is no dedicated macro or condition that evaluates the situation for config 3. We will discuss the mechanics of config 3 later.

### Macro #4: largebin_index(sz)
---

This macro is a high level handler for the largebin index calculation. It delegates the calculation based on the config#, unlike smallbins, which have one single handler doing everything.
```c
#define largebin_index(sz)    (  \
  (SIZE_SZ == 8)                 \
  ? largebin_index_64(sz)        \
  : (MALLOC_ALIGNMENT == 16)     \
    ? largebin_index_32_big(sz)  \
    : largebin_index_32(sz)      \
)
```

SIZE_SZ=8 is for 64-bit, MALLOC_ALIGNMENT=16 catches the INTERNAL_SIZE_T=4 case (config #3) and the remaining one is for 32-bit. Let's start with `largebin_index_64`.

### The Naming Issue
---

There is a naming issue in the bin_index macros. Their output is not an index value. Let's understand the situation.

By index, we imply a value which can be subscripted (or indexed) in an array to find a specific element.

Array subscripting is simply a syntactic sugar built over: `(base + i*scale)`. For example.
```c
int arr[100];
// considering the width of int 4.
```

Suppose i=15. Take these two cases and answer what is the index here.
  1. arr[i]
  2. arr[(i\*4) + 4]

I hope the answers is 15 and 64. Is it?
  - arr[5] is (arr + 5*4).
  - arr[(i\*4) + 4] is (arr + ( (i\*4)+4 )*4)

***`i` is not an index. It is simply a variable participating in the calculation of the index value.***
  - In the first case, `i` was used literally.
  - In the second case, `i` underwent some arithmetic to compute the index.

Now look at what these macros are generating. Take smallbin_index for example. The largest smallbin size class on 64-bit is for 1008 bytes. Right shift it by 4, we get 63. Since bins are implemented as headers, we have to undergo a calculation to access the correct headers.
```c
// 0-based indexing
struct Node* fake_node = (Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[i*2])-8);

// 1-based indexing
struct Node* fake_node = (Node*)((char*)(&listHeaders[(i-1)*2])-8);
```

The output of `smallbin_index` or `largebin_index_*` macros is "a bin number" which participates in the final index calculation performed by the `bin_at(M, i)` macro.
```c
typedef struct malloc_chunk *mbinptr;

#define  bin_at(m, i)    (mbinptr) ( \
  ((char*) &( (m)->bins[(i-1)*2] )) - offsetof(struct malloc_chunk, fd)  \
)
```

And for this reason, "bin_number" is a more appropriate naming than "bin_index".

### Macro #5: bin_at(M, i)

It is the macro that operationalize the fake chunk implementation. It receives a bin number corresponding to a size and then calculates the appropriate bin for it.
```c
#define  bin_at(m, i)    (mbinptr) ( \
  ((char*) &( (m)->bins[(i-1)*2] )) - offsetof(struct malloc_chunk, fd)  \
)
```
